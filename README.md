# DeepQLearning.jl
Julia implementation of DeepMind's Deep Q-Learning algorithm as described in [Playing Atari with Deep Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.5602)

*note: This library seems to be working correctly on various learning tasks, but is not yet ready for public consumptions.*

## Example code
```julia
using DeepQLearning

... coming soon ... I hope :)
```

##Dependencies 
This library requires [NNGraph.jl](https://github.com/Andy-P/NNGraph.jl). 

##Credits
